The goal of this newsletter is to share my ongoing notes on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/) development.
Notable updates from both Protocol Labs and the community, new relases, notable discussions and more.

This first update actually covers the last two weeks or so... forgive me

**8/3 – IPFS @ dweb conference**
* Juan Benet demo’s Filecoin network simulation at the Distributed Web conference last week. Embedded above or [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/kW6e1GCpqpE?t=6h53m41s)
* dweb conference was hosted by Internet Archive in San Francisco
* Brewster Kahle unveiled a copy of Internet Archive stored on IFPS: [his blog post](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/08/11/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web-2/), [Wired coverage](https://www.wired.com/2016/06/inventors-internet-trying-build-truly-permanent-web/)
* I'm told the [IPFS lightning talks](...) @ Dweb were also solid but haven't watched yet
* Lots of demonstrations of libp2p as a core networking library. Also still active interest in [switching Ethereum from netp2p to libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p/issues/33) + [older Stack Overflow thread](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/12290/what-is-the-distinction-between-libp2p-devp2p-and-rlpx)
* Protocol Labs hosted an event called Lab Day on Friday
  * [Arkadiy Kukarkin @parkan](https://twitter.com/parkan/status/1022938544686465024): if you're coming to #DWebSummit next week you should stick around for the @protocollabs Lab Day on friday: full day of expanded versions of the lightning talks from the main event + more! https://lab-day.com/2018

**8/7 – New format for weekly all-hands call**
* Historically ad-hoc demos and Q&A, will be be focused more on presentations planned in advance
* @flyingzumwalt: "Proposal: Switch the format of the weekly calls on Monday to focus on 1-2 pre-scheduled presentations, demos or discussions. Set the schedule 6-8 weeks in advance, so we can advertise a calendar of who will be presenting and what will be covered."
* Issue: [ipfs/pm/#636](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/636)

**New golang team weekly sync**
* Public standup format, la js-ipfs team
* @daviddias: "Our thinking is that we can improve communication a lot, helping everyone get a better shared understanding of the project priorities and capacity available, so that we know better how to allocate work and enable everyone to have laser focus on a set of tasks."
* Proposed in issue [ipfs/pm/#673](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/673)
* First meeting: [ipfs/pm/#674](https://github.com/ipfs/pm/issues/674)

**Related, great calendar of IPFS team meetings**
* [Google calendar link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ipfs.io_eal36ugu5e75s207gfjcu0ae84@group.calendar.google.com&ctz=UTC) - all the public calls & special events in one spot
* Documented in [ipfs/community/](https://github.com/ipfs/community#calendar)

**New IPFS Discord server**
* &rarr; https://discord.gg/6BFdAh
* Started by @shoku, mentioned in the official #ipfs IRC channel
* Note that IRC freenode #ipfs (and related) are still the official channel
* Ed: I'm a long-time IRC user but recent spam attacks on Freenode starting to show IRC's age. Also interesting to see the # of platforms being used for crypto dev communities: IRC, Slack, Discord, Gitter, Rocketchat, and those are just the ones I remember offhand... in pretty stark contrast to historical open-source development, which was predominantly IRC

**IPFS conf has been delayed from "November 2018" to "2019"**
* Commit: https://github.com/ipfs/conf/commit/2ef784cf361593573b5f796d415fe90ecd7939cc
* Event will be held in Lisbon, planned to be more general than the developer-specific meeting in Berlin last month
* &rarr; GitHub repository: https://github.com/ipfs/conf

**[How to build a self-editing p2p webpage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud7WXPCxHyc)**
* @victorbjelkholm livestreamed this, ~4.5 hours total
* "step-by-step how you can build a P2P browser application by using js-ipfs and other P2P technologies."
* &rarr; GitHub repository: https://github.com/VictorBjelkholm/self-editing-website
